      <h2>Um, hi.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I'm an old bloke who's done software development for a living since the early 80's. Yes, that's an old picture... over 40 years old, in fact.<br> 
        During the late '80s and '90's, I was sidetracked with consultancy and management. I hated the first bit, and I loathed the second bit profusely. 
        I would then complain about that at odd times ("maaan, I wish I'd stuck to writing code")... so in 2002, I kicked myself in the butt, decided to throw my career 
        in reverse, read a pile of books on modern development tools, design patterns and techniques, and a year later, got back to doing what I loved most.</p>
        <p class="intro">I've been a .NET backend developer for 15 years, and I'm interested in learning more about modern front end technology... 
        which is why I put myself down for the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">Udemy Complete Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu</a>. 
        Who should really work on losing her vocal fry, but otherwise does a stellar job.</p>
        <p class="intro">On this course, and two others, I'm the proud course buddy of the one and only Laura Hamm. She's something else... she's bloody bright, she's got a developer mindset, 
        and she's thrown herself on this thing like a starved pitbull on a steaming pork roast, so I'm pretty sure we haven't seen the last of her. </p>
